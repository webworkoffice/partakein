# How to build and run PARTAKE.

= Introduction =

This page describes how to build PARTAKE on eclipse and run on Tomcat 6.

= Details =

We use eclipse 3.6 (Java EE platform) with m2eclipse plugin.

  # checkout PARTAKE from http://code.google.com/p/partakein/source/checkout 
  # On eclipse, select File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project. Set Project name as you like (we recommend to use "Partake"), and set Project location where you saved the file, and press Next >.
    * set Target runtime to Apache Tomcat v6.0
    * set Dynamic web module version to 2.5
  # Now we are on "build path" page, set the following configurations, and press Next >.
    * set "Source folders on build path" as "src/main/java", "src/main/resource", and "src/test/main".
    * set "Default output folder:" to "target/classes".
  # set Context root as "/", and set "Content directory" as "src/main/webapp", then press Finish
  # If you are using Windows, do not forget to set project encoding to utf-8.
  # right click on Partake project, and choose Maven -> enable project management.
  # right click on Partake project, and choose Maven -> update project configuration. This may take a minute.
  # The previous step may change your build path automatically. Check the build path again.
    * src/main/java, src/main/resource, and src/test/java should be included.
    * In "Order and Export" pane, Maven dependencies and Web App Libraries are should be checked.
  # On Markers pane, you may see Classpath Dependency Validator Message.
     * In this case, right click it and select Quick fix, and press Finish. This will fix the problem.
  # Then choose Run on Server.

Since you have not configure PARTAKE, you will see an error message.

  # Download Apache Cassandra (0.6.5) and run on localhost. Maybe you have to set up data and index directories.
  # fill src/main/resource/sample.partake.properties (especially bitly)
    * a partake.properties file has in.partake.mode property. The value of this property is called "mode".
    * partake will read {mode}.partake.properties.
  # rename src/main/resource/twitter4j.properties.sample as src/main/resource/twitter4j.properties.
    * set your project name consumer key and consumer secret given from twitter.

Then you can run PARTAKE now.
