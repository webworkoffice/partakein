This page describes how to build PARTAKE on eclipse and run on Tomcat 6.

= Details =

We use eclipse 3.6 (Java EE platform) with m2eclipse plugin.

  # checkout PARTAKE from http://code.google.com/p/partakein/source/checkout 
  # On eclipse, select File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project. Set Project name as you like (we recommend to use "Partake"), and set Project location where you saved the file, and press Next >.
    * set Target runtime to Apache Tomcat v6.0
    * set Dynamic web module version to 2.5
  # Now we are on "build path" page, set the following configurations, and press Next >.
    * set "Source folders on build path" as "src/main/java", "src/main/resource", and "src/test/main".
    * set "Default output folder:" to "target/classes".
  # set Context root as "/", and set "Content directory" as "src/main/webapp", then press Finish
  # If you are using Windows, do not forget to set project encoding to utf-8.
  # right click on Partake project, and choose Maven -> enable project management.
  # right click on Partake project, and choose Properties. Then choose Java Build Path page, and choose Orders and Export, and check Maven Dependencies and Web App Libraries. Then press OK.
  # On Markers pain, you may see Classpath Dependency Validator Message.
     * In this case, right click and select Quick fix, and press Finish.
  # Then choose Run on Server.

Since you have not configure Partake, you will see error message.

  # Download Apache Cassandra (0.6.5) and run on localhost.
  # fill src/main/resource/sample.partake.properties (especially bitly)
    * partake.properties can set in.partake.mode property. 
    * partake will read <mode>.partake.properties
  # rename src/main/resource/twitter4j.properties.sample as src/main/resource/twitter4j.properties.
    * set your project name consumer key and consumer secret given from twitter.

Then you can run Partake now.
